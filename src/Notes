utils_settings.php
  function get_db_settings() { return array("db_host","db_user","db_pass","db_name"); } 
  function salt_pass()   { return md5("salt string".$pass); }
   - there was somethign else I wanted here - timeout maybe?
   - maybe utils_settings should be in the repository with the values above?
     is there a way to do this and keep it from overwriting our local copies
     every time we do a svn update?

storing date strings in the database
  using DATETIME type, converting at the last minute with <?php date("m/d/Y", $db_date) ?>

  I wish hitting enter had some well-defined effect:

Authentication [low priority]
  can't a malicious user eavesdrop on (a) someone's session id or (b) someone's
  md5'd password, both of which are transmitted in plaintext over the wifi?
    does adding a nonce somehow fix this?
