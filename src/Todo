*Readme* - major stuff

#### Aug 2013
    fix run_module.js toggles to use Toggle class

#### July 2013
  Interface:
    module teams / seeding
    tournament details
    module details
    finish blank entries on elim bracket display
    elim standings in-progress should give ranks for eliminated teams only
    options for various under-the-hood mechanisms (tie-break, matchups, odd#)
    better field validation (mostly just strip certain things to alnum/etc: email, slug, name, etc)
    seed teams from prior modules
  Core:
    better max likelihood?
    link-only mode
    no rematches
    EVENT LOG
    auto game-add in elim
    figure out round/game-add for swiss
    add round-robin mode
  Other:
    update the About page
    admin settings?
    auto-update for view -games
    get rid of view.php, make link from run (and tournament?) to public
    #tblModule->module_title should be tblModule->module_name, change all
    fix dblelim colors
    fix winners bracket final display of winner (dblelim, sgl also?)
    
#### June 2013
  Fix Immediate:
    Initial team seeds
    Display of elim tournaments
        #display lines connecting games
        display empty [winner of] [loser of] lines
        display game numbers / identifier?
    Auto add-games for elim tournaments

#### May 2013
  Pending:
    #finish moving to raise new Exception(msg) paradigm that I should've done ages ago
    #finish tournament->module->round->game hierarchy
    #delete tournament should recurse properly over modules/moduleteams/games/etc 
    delete module should recurse
    #sort rank based on MaxLikelihood
    figure out how we're going to pick matchups (consecutive or +8 or something)
    EVENT LOG
        new/delete tournament
        login/out
    #Delete Game
    #Run Module should work:
    #    move next-round button into javascript
    #    update 'victor' class in javascript
        #display-games all at once (list 'round' in swiss, 'final-four' in sglelim)
        add games automatically as other games finish
            don't actually add these games to the db until in-progress/score/etc
            instead, use javascript to add them to the top of the run/disp
            (though this means that the viewer-end will need its own javascript future-prediction)
            ---could grey-out whole predictive rounds / not display on viewer-end until a game in them has started
               and in this fashion work out the swiss-continuation problem?
        #split dblelim into winners/losers brackets (wb-bye / lb-bye?)
  Less Urgent:      
    #standings should style as a table, as should disp_teams_list
    #tournament_isadmin($tid,$aid) => ($tid) and gets aid from $_SESSION -- need to change all instances
    #redesign new-tournament creation
    #better way to do page header 
    #    not just include(header.php) but more like display_head(extra_bits)
    #    fix header.php to just include header get/set/disp functions, not output/unexpected side-effects
    #fix delete-tournament
    #jesus christ, I've never had to deal with making changes in-place on working software
    # - I want desperately to restructure the whole thing, but can't while it's in use
    #(n.b. totally restructuring in-place.  leaving old db stuff as a scaffold until we hot-swap)
    Choice between Min Likelihood / wins-buchholz for seeding
    Status string (Round 2: x games finished or Losers Bracket Finals or sweet sixteen/elite eight/final four)
    #any POSTS to self should be rewritten as xmlhttprequest

##### Feb 2013:
  Urgent: 
    #[done] Make sure double elim works for 2^k+n teams
    #[done sort of] SRS / Max Likelihood
    #[done] Better view page (games)
    swiss matchups -> random pairings within record group(?) + brute-force no rematch
        or maybe split into k-groups (4? 8?) for most useful seeding info
    #use Min Likelihood for team Rankings
  Soon:
    Better team add (javascript async, cut/paste, import from various files)
    #Tournament modules
    #Consolidate forms (score, etc) and use javascript for async form update
    #Better game sched page
    #Modal dialogs

##### Aug 2012:
  #  [ partially implemented, then discarded? ]
  #view.php?id=$tid&round_id=$rid&view=results - partial results view clicking on R1,R2,etc 
  #       sorted for the round and with the subsequent round results visible but greyed out

##### May 2012:
Urgent:
  #[partial done] Get double elim team pairings working.
  #                  To do this move pos over to display.
  #[done? added LvW-bracket to display] Also move add_game into get_pairings to add[loser v winner] (v rematch?)
  #[done] Check apostrophes (htmlentities) in all fields [team names break]

Todo:
  #[done] Import xml file
  #[done] Different modes for view.php [overall rank, bracket, etc]
  Auto-detect tourney done
  add/update team and set/update score should return to anchor links
  #[done] Fix Session-Timeout [before we've been kicked but after timeout we can still do >= 1 thing]

Want:
  Auto add-matches for elim
  #[sort of done]Better import from other sections
  Some fault-checking in XML team import [and maybe a link to the spec?]

##### Apr 2012:

Modes:
  Swiss / Single Elim / Double Elim / Round Robin / Monday Night
  Want: Tournament -> section [mode] -> Rounds
    where each tournament has multiple section with ways to import teams/starting-ranks from other
    sections, each section with its own mode.  So for example, we have sections, Swiss A, Swiss B,
    Swiss C, each imports 1/3 of teams from tournament pool, random starting rank, Swiss mode.  Then
    section Single Elim importing top 8 teams from each Swiss section.
  Should these be called Sections?  Brackets?  Pools?  Divisions?  'Single Elim Division' doesn't
    make sense.  'Final Division'.  I don't know.

  But for now:  Tournament [mode] -> Rounds
    with a mechanism for importing teams/ranks from other tournaments where [owner] is an [admin]

Manual game schedule:
  #[done] Check BYE v BYE

Public View:
  view.php should display some recent games / upcoming games

Navigating Teams:
  tournament.php needs a nicer way to deal with teams:
    #[done sort of] Import from file, url(?), textbox, OTHER TOURNAMENT
    #[done] Delete button for team if !exist games with that team in them
    Disable needs more explanation
    Single button to update all teams

Inputs:  (js) Any time text has been modified, add class 'selected' to indicate this

tblPlayer:
  player id / player uid / player name
  tblPlayerTeam
    player id / team id
  when importing / adding players to teams check for existing player uid
    if old_name == new_name where old_uid == new_uid then add old_id to the team and don't make a new
    tblPlayer entry - else do [so new id, duplicate uid, new name is a possible scenario]
  at some point maybe we'll stat by uid and just have "Alias" x,y,z

##### Sep 2011:

Cross-browser compatibility:
  check that things render reasonably on various browsers.
  we're really ugly on ie7/8/9, which all of them ignore nth-child

Forms:
  get rid of those page-spanning forms - don't write forms that span their own
  containg div's close tag

Header:
  want to move all navigation to the header
  should figure out which page we're on to 'selected' out the appropriate button
  pages should have(?) a secondary header that's page-specific - maybe as a left sidebar

Pairings:
  need a way to guarantee no rematches.  current method tries a little, but not very hard.
  could form an edge-weighted graph and find a minimal perfect matching.
    see paper here: www.disco.ethz.ch/publications/ctw04.pdf
    and further discussion here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5203894/a-good-approximation-algorithm-for-the-maximum-weight-perfect-match-in-non-bipart
  but this is kind of overkill.  We could probably modify our current algorithm to just
  backtrack a little, but who knows if this will work in arbitrary environments (i.e. with
  a medium amount of teams, like twenty or thirty, and a bunch of rounds)
  We should make sure that it does.

connect_to_db
  I've set things up such that we throw away our db connection and just reconnect
    a bunch of times every page load.  Is this why things feel so laggy today?
    If so, we need to fix that.  Fffffuuuuuuuuuuu

Trying to condense a bunch of pages down to - admin.php, tournament.php, etc
  structure should generally look like:
  *check $_POST['action'] to see if there is stuff to do
      offload the doing into included utils files
      and header(location:) to wherever we should end up
  *page display

some stuff on session_start() instead of session_register()
  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7194457/whats-wrong-with-session-register
  and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3319231/what-are-session-id-session-regenerate-id-and-session-name-used-for
