*Readme* - major stuff

##### May 2012:
Urgent:
  Get double elim team pairings working.
  To do this move pos over to display.
  Also move add_game into get_pairings to add[loser v winner] (v rematch?)
  Check apostrophes (htmlentities) in all fields [team names break]

Todo:
  Import xml file
  Different modes for view.php [overall rank, bracket, etc]
  Auto-detect tourney done
  Finish no-rematches-alg for swiss
  add/update team and set/update score should return to anchor links

Want:
  Auto add-matches for elim
  Better import from other sections

##### Apr 2012:

Modes:
  Swiss / Single Elim / Double Elim / Round Robin / Monday Night
  Want: Tournament -> section [mode] -> Rounds
    where each tournament has multiple section with ways to import teams/starting-ranks from other
    sections, each section with its own mode.  So for example, we have sections, Swiss A, Swiss B,
    Swiss C, each imports 1/3 of teams from tournament pool, random starting rank, Swiss mode.  Then
    section Single Elim importing top 8 teams from each Swiss section.
  Should these be called Sections?  Brackets?  Pools?  Divisions?  'Single Elim Division' doesn't
    make sense.  'Final Division'.  I don't know.

  But for now:  Tournament [mode] -> Rounds
    with a mechanism for importing teams/ranks from other tournaments where [owner] is an [admin]

Manual game schedule:
  Check BYE v BYE

Public View:
  view.php should display some recent games / upcoming games

Navigating Teams:
  tournament.php needs a nicer way to deal with teams:
    Import from file, url(?), textbox, OTHER TOURNAMENT
    Delete button for team if !exist games with that team in them
    Disable needs more explanation
    Single button to update all teams

Inputs:  (js) Any time text has been modified, add class 'selected' to indicate this

tblPlayer:
  player id / player uid / player name
  tblPlayerTeam
    player id / team id
  when importing / adding players to teams check for existing player uid
    if old_name == new_name where old_uid == new_uid then add old_id to the team and don't make a new
    tblPlayer entry - else do [so new id, duplicate uid, new name is a possible scenario]
  at some point maybe we'll stat by uid and just have "Alias" x,y,z

##### Sep 2011:

Cross-browser compatibility:
  check that things render reasonably on various browsers.
  we're really ugly on ie7/8/9, which all of them ignore nth-child

Forms:
  get rid of those page-spanning forms - don't write forms that span their own
  containg div's close tag

Header:
  want to move all navigation to the header
  should figure out which page we're on to 'selected' out the appropriate button
  pages should have(?) a secondary header that's page-specific - maybe as a left sidebar

Pairings:
  need a way to guarantee no rematches.  current method tries a little, but not very hard.
  could form an edge-weighted graph and find a minimal perfect matching.
    see paper here: www.disco.ethz.ch/publications/ctw04.pdf
    and further discussion here:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5203894/a-good-approximation-algorithm-for-the-maximum-weight-perfect-match-in-non-bipart
  but this is kind of overkill.  We could probably modify our current algorithm to just
  backtrack a little, but who knows if this will work in arbitrary environments (i.e. with
  a medium amount of teams, like twenty or thirty, and a bunch of rounds)
  We should make sure that it does.

connect_to_db
  I've set things up such that we throw away our db connection and just reconnect
    a bunch of times every page load.  Is this why things feel so laggy today?
    If so, we need to fix that.  Fffffuuuuuuuuuuu

Trying to condense a bunch of pages down to - admin.php, tournament.php, etc
  structure should generally look like:
  *check $_POST['action'] to see if there is stuff to do
      offload the doing into included utils files
      and header(location:) to wherever we should end up
  *page display

some stuff on session_start() instead of session_register()
  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7194457/whats-wrong-with-session-register
  and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3319231/what-are-session-id-session-regenerate-id-and-session-name-used-for
