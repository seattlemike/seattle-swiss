20Swiss ("Two Oh Swiss") is a piece of tournament software by Paul Danos and
Mike Bell, realeased under the GNU AGPL (see COPYING for a copy of this license,
and information on how to use / modify / redistribute this source).  Mike and
Paul can be reached by email at, respectively, [ mike at seattleswiss dot com ]
and [ paul at seattleswiss dot com ].

20Swiss is designed to be a free, public system on which users can host and run
tournaments of varying types, with an option for public display of the results.
As of v0.2 we support Swiss Rounds, Single Elimination, and Double Elimination
tournaments.

20Swiss v0.x is written mostly in (PHP)[http://php.net/] with a smattering of
(Javascript)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript] to help a bit with the
flow.  Almost all of the processing takes place on the server, with HTML Forms
mediating client/server communication.  This will change significantly for v1.0.
